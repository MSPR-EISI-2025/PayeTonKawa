## GitFlow
### Main Branches:

- main: contains the stable version deployed to production.

- develop: contains the code currently in development, ready for integration.

### Supporting Branches:

- feature/*: used for developing new features. Created from `develop`, merged back into `develop`.

- release/*: used to prepare a new production release. Created from `develop`, merged into both `main` and `develop`.

- hotfix/*: used to fix critical bugs in production. Created from `main`, merged into both `main` and `develop`.

### Examples:

- New feature:
  `git checkout -b feature/develop/"my_ticket" develop`

- Preparing a release:
  `git checkout -b release/1.0.0 develop`

- Urgent fix:
  `git checkout -b hotfix/"source_branch"/"my_ticket" main`

## Connect NestJS to RabbitMQ
- In each API (clients, orders, product), update main.ts:
```javascript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import { MicroserviceOptions, Transport } from '@nestjs/microservices';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

  app.connectMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>({
    transport: Transport.RMQ,
    options: {
      urls: ['amqp://user:password@rabbitmq:5672'],
      queue: 'your_service_queue', // unique for each service
      queueOptions: {
        durable: false
      },
    },
  });

  await app.startAllMicroservices();
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

- Each service should use a different queue name (clients_queue, orders_queue, etc.).

- To verify if RabbitMQ is working, there is the management UI : http://localhost:15672
- Login: user / password
